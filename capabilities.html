        <button class="collapsible-header"><span class="arrow">▶</span>Arithmetic and Core Features</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content">

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Creating Lists</h3>
          <p>
            The TI-84+CE lets you create and manage lists to organize sets of data. Using the <b>STAT → EDIT</b> menu, 
            you can enter multiple lists for statistical analysis, regression, and graphing. Lists are powerful tools 
            for comparing data sets, performing operations across values, and visualizing relationships.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Statistics Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Within the <b>STAT → CALC</b> menu, the calculator can compute one-variable and two-variable statistics, 
            run regressions, and find measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation coefficients. 
            These are especially useful for analyzing data in algebra, statistics, and science classes.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Matrices</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>2nd → x<sup>-1</sup></b> key opens the <b>MATRIX</b> menu, which lets you create, edit, and perform operations on matrices. 
            You can add, subtract, multiply, find determinants, inverses, and use matrices for solving systems of equations. 
            The TI-84+CE handles both numeric and symbolic matrix calculations efficiently.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Using Variables and the Store Function</h3>
          <p>
            You can store values, equations, or expressions into variables using the <b>STO→</b> key. 
            For example, typing <code>5 → A</code> stores 5 in variable A. This allows you to reuse values 
            across different problems or computations without retyping them, making your workflow more efficient.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">The MATH Menu</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>MATH</b> button is one of the most versatile on the calculator. It provides access to 
            functions like fractions, roots, exponents, absolute value, and advanced operations like numerical derivatives 
            and integrals. You’ll also find tools for converting between decimals and fractions and managing complex numbers.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">The Apps Section</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>APPS</b> button gives access to preinstalled and user-added applications like Finance, 
            Conics, and Inequality Graphing. These apps extend the calculator’s power by adding specialized features 
            beyond what’s available in the default menus.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Draw Menu</h3>
          <p>
            Accessed through <b>2nd → PRGM</b>, the <b>DRAW</b> menu lets you draw lines, circles, and text on graphs. 
            You can label points of interest or visually mark intersections and solutions, making it a creative way 
            to annotate and interpret graphs.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Angle and Distribution Menus</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>ANGLE</b> menu (<b>2nd → APPS</b>) provides functions for converting between degrees and radians, 
            inserting the π symbol, and working with unit vectors. The <b>DISTR</b> menu (<b>2nd → VARS</b>) 
            contains statistical distributions such as normalpdf, binompdf, and invNorm — essential for probability and statistics.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">2nd Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Many keys on the TI-84+CE have secondary functions accessed by pressing the <b>2nd</b> key. 
            These include shortcuts to features like inserting the degree symbol, opening setup menus, 
            accessing memory, or quitting applications. Mastering 2nd functions dramatically improves speed and efficiency.

      <!-- MAIN HEADER 2: Catalog -->
      <div class="collapsible">
        <button class="collapsible-header"><span class="arrow">▶</span>The Catalog</button>
        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <p>
            The <b>CATALOG</b> function (accessed with <b>2nd → 0</b>) is a complete alphabetical list of every 
            command and function available on your calculator. It’s an essential reference tool when you can’t 
            find a function in the regular menus. You can scroll through commands or jump to a specific letter 
            by pressing the corresponding key. The catalog ensures you never miss a capability that might 
            not be visible elsewhere, making it one of the most powerful resources on the TI-84+CE.

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Preinstalled Apps</h3>
          <p>
            Your calculator comes with built-in apps like <b>Finance</b>, <b>Transform</b>, and <b>Inequality Graphing</b>. 
            You can also install new apps to extend its functionality — for instance, games, scientific tools, or 
            custom math utilities. To learn how to install apps on your TI-84+CE, visit 
            <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA0E4C67D6E04E4E8C8E4F67F80CBB21/ti-connect-ce" target="_blank">this TI Education guide</a>.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Programming in TI-BASIC</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>PRGM</b> button opens the programming interface, where you can write, edit, and run 
            programs written in TI-BASIC — the calculator’s built-in language. You can make programs that 
            perform repetitive calculations, generate patterns, draw shapes, or even play simple games. 
            TI-BASIC is easy to learn and a great introduction to coding logic and structure.

      <!-- MAIN HEADER 4: Starting Your Own Programs -->
      <div class="collapsible">
        <button class="collapsible-header"><span class="arrow">▶</span>How to Start Programming</button>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Installing TI-Connect CE Software</h3>
          <p>
            To transfer or manage programs, download and install <b>TI-Connect CE</b> on your computer. 
            It allows you to connect your calculator via USB, organize files, and send or receive data. 
            You can find it on Texas Instruments’ official site.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Using the Link Function</h3>
          <p>
            The <b>LINK</b> feature (accessible through <b>2nd → X,T,θ,n</b>) lets you send and receive programs, 
            lists, and data between calculators or between your calculator and a computer. This is useful 
            for sharing projects or transferring games and utilities.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Making a Simple Program (Quadratic Formula Example)</h3>
          <p>
            You can create a new program by pressing <b>PRGM → NEW</b> and naming it. 
            For example, to make a quadratic formula solver, use input commands for A, B, and C, 
            then compute <code>(-B ± √(B²-4AC)) / (2A)</code>. Programs like these make problem-solving faster 
            and help you understand logical structuring in code. See full syntax help at 
            <a href="https://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">TI-BASIC Developer Wiki</a>.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color:#3399ff;">Python on TI-84+CE</h3>
          <p>
            Some newer TI-84+CE models include built-in Python capability. 
            It allows for more complex programs with loops, lists, and real data handling.
